                <h1>My Life:</h1>
                <p> My name is Manuel Najera, friends call me Manny for short. I was born and grew up in Brooklyn.
                    I'm in a family of five. Me and my father are the only guys in our family the rest are just Women.
                    My older siser is 18 and she's working to be a EMT, my little sister is 12 and she just started middle school.
                    My Father works as a painter/construction worker for bridges.My mom doesn't have job but she takes care of me and my 
                    sisters. 
                </p>
                <p1>I play chess and I'm in this program that helps me prepare for collage. It's called Chess in the Schools.I met a lot of friends 
                    in that program and I treat them as family because we care about each other. During the summer of 2018 I joined 
                    a computer science program that is called All Star code it's a cool program and i'm learning a lot of cool imformatio 
                    about computer science.We treat each other like brothers which is pretty cool.
